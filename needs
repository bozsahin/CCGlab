You need a linux/unix system, either real or in a virtual box such as Oracle's.
That will give you what CCGlab needs for fully automatic install:
====================
bash (shell for linux)
sed (stream editor)
apt-get or brew (installers for linux or MacOS systems)
wget (downloader)
zip (compressor/decompressor)
=====================

They come mostly standard in many linuxes. To make sure, do 'which apt-get' etc to find out.
You need them before CCGlab install.
