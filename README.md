# ccglab
Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG): All combinators, native input format, parsing to logical form (aka semantic parsing), parameter estimation for probabilistic CCG.

This is Common Lisp code. Easy-installer installs a CL for you (SBCL), and downloads and installs all files.
If you already have an ANSI Common Lisp, it can work with it too.

The maintainance site for CCGlab is https://tinyURL.com/ccglab-tool

You will find more instructions and pointers there.

One day I will integrate the git and dropbox version.

Right now, the git repo is just a pointer to the latest in CCGlab at dropbox.
