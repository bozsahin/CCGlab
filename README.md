# ccglab
Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG): All combinators, native input format, parsing to logical form (aka semantic parsing), parameter estimation for probabilistic CCG.

All you need is the easy-install.zip. Unzip it in a directory. When you run the revealed script you will get CCGlab/ in that directory if it is a fresh install. Otherwise it will ask you how to upgrade an old CCGlab.

This is Common Lisp code. Easy-installer installs a CL for you (SBCL), and downloads and installs all necesssary files.
If you already have an ANSI Common Lisp, it can work with it too.

Current version is 3.0, use (which-ccglab) in your system to find out if you've got the latest.
