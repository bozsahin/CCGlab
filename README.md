# ccglab
Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG): All combinators, native input format, parsing to logical form (aka semantic parsing), parameter estimation for probabilistic CCG.

This is Common Lisp code. Easy-installer installs a CL for you (SBCL), and downloads and installs all necesssary files.
If you already have an ANSI Common Lisp, it can work with it too.

Right now, the git repo is just a pointer to the latest in CCGlab at dropbox.
