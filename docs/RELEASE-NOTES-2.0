=================================
For version 2.0  -- June 2016
=================================

Changes from the previous version:

1. Probabilistic CCG (PCCG) is now fully implemented, with lexical features.
   A plugin is provided to add other kinds of features.
2. PCCG version of log-likelihood of training set and its derivative 
   calculation are implemented.
3. Gradient-ascent is implemented. 2 and 3 give parameter estimation,
   which is made part of the modeling workflow.
   The manual has a new section on model development.
4. Lexical entries in .ded/.ind files now have
   a unique KEY feature, for lexical counts without hazards.
5. There is a new file type, .sup, for supervision source.
6. 'tokens' script can now be called from within Lisp to make all CCGlab 
   workflows Lisp-internal. NB load-grammar function. 
   You can continue to use it the old way, from command line. I don't.
   Models are loaded by calling the load-model function. 
7. As a consequence of 6, make-and-load-grammar function is deprecated.
8. 'tokenize.sed' script is deprecated. It's built into 'tokens'.
9. A mini demo of .ccg -> .ded -> .ind -> .sup -> .ind -> parse rank
   model development workflow can be seen for the project 'corner'.
10.Install instructions are reduced to one workflow, and ccglab.lisp
   file for loading CCGlab is deprecated.

Thanks for using CCGlab.
