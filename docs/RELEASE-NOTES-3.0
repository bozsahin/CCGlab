=================================
For version 3.0  -- March 2017
=================================

Changes from the previous version:

1. Hash table defaults are now much larger, for long training sessions.
2. Supervision files need not be coded by hand. There is now a converter
   from a high-level sentence : LF syntax to low-level .sup file.
3. You can z-score the parameters to see how far they deviate
   from the mean in terms of std deviation.
4. The rules can be controlled by switches.
5. Saving a training session is now less threatening to original
   grammar.
6. suptokens bash script is added to implement #2.
7. Some shortcuts are added for top level functions. See the end of
   ccg.lisp. Some session saves in contrib/ use them.
8. You can control LF display of a derivation using show-lf and hide-lf.

Thanks for using CCGlab.
