<h3> <code>CCGlab</code> upgrades</h3>

<p> Upgrades do not need install or re-install. They are revisions to <code>CCGlab</code> code
and/or additions of grammars or models.

<p> For any upgrade, you need 
<ul>
<li> <code>bash, unzip</code> and <code>wget</code>. You have them if you have
already succesfully installed <code>CCGlab</code>.
<li> Write permission to your <code>$CCGLAB_HOME</code> directory.
<li> NOTE: upgrades overwrite system code in this directory and leave others unchanged. Please do not change <code>CCGlab</code>'s system files
so that you don't lose your valuable work.
</ul>

<p> To upgrade:
<ul>
<li> download the upgrade to some location in your local machine.
<li> unzip it. It will create one bash executable called <code>ccglab-upgrade</code>.
<li> run the executable: <code>$ ./ccglab-upgrade</code>
<li> Next time you run <code>CCGlab</code>, upgraded code will be loaded.
</ul>
