<p> <big><code>CCGlab</code></big> download/install:
<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/65145236/CCGlab/downloads/easy-install.zip">Automatic download and install script.</a>

<p> READ BELOW before you run the install script.

<p>Download this wee script only, unzip it in a directory where you want <code>CCGlab</code>
installed. It contains just one bash script. Run it like this:
<br><code>$ ./ccglab-download-and-install</code>
<br>It downloads and installs the latest version in your <em>working</em> directory, and
names the subfolder <code>CCGlab</code>.
<br><code>SBCL</code> and <code>rlwrap</code> go to their default directories as defined in their packages.

<p>If you have <code>apt-get</code> or <code>brew</code>, <code> sed, wget</code> and <code>bash</code>, the script above
will download and install ccglab code, lalrparser code, SBCL code and rlwrap code. 

<p>You can check whether you have them by doing <code>which app</code>
at command line where app is one of the names above.

<p>Below is more detailed information. 

<p><code>CCGlab</code> needs: (1) a real linux/unix environment, or a linux
virtual box which you can install for Windows. (2) Some Lisp code.
<p>The install package above takes care of (2). For (1), see the bottom of the page.

<p>To fully automate the download and install, you need a package manager to install a Lisp as well,
either <code>apt-get</code> (for linuxes) or <code>brew</code> (for Mac OS). Make sure you have one of them
if you want fully automated install. Use e.g. `<code>which apt-get</code>'
command to find out whether you have <code>apt-get</code>.

<p> Automatic install first downloads then installs <code>CCGlab</code>.
If you can <code>sudo</code> on your machine, i.e. if you can be a superuser, it can install <code> SBCL</code> Lisp
and <code>rlwrap</code> as well. If you don't have that permission, it just
does <code>CCGlab</code> and lalrparser.lisp downloads and install, and leaves
the Common Lisp and rlwrap to you.  So you can bypass Lisp installation in the install script if you already have one.
(In that case, the installer asks for your Lisp's path.)

<p>NOTE: It won't install <code>CCGlab</code> if there is no
local Lisp. Follow this path if you already have a local ANSI Common Lisp (note: GNU lisps, GCL and CLISP,
are <em>not</em> ANSI!). 

<p> <code>rlwrap</code> is optional, and highly recommended.
It gives you command recall, which is VERY convenient.

<p>The easy installer will guide you through these options, and issue warnings where necessary.

<p> Some free (and very good ) ANSI Common Lisp cites and other goodies:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.sbcl.org">Steel Bank Common Lisp</a>
<li> <a href="http://ccl.clozure.com">Clozure Common Lisp</a>
<li> <a href="http://freecode.com/projects/rlwrap">rlwrap</a> (command recaller; very nice for CCGlab/Lisp's toplevel interface)
<li> <a href="http://brew.sh">brew</a> (package manager for MACOS X)
</ul>

<p>I did not include Lispworks Personal Edition here although it's free and ANSI,
because it does not allow loading code from init files, which is
what <code>CCGlab</code> does.

<p> <code>CCGlab</code> has been tested in both Lisp systems, and in MacOS, Ubuntu and virtual boxes. (Cygwin, anyone?)

<p>Development was done almost fully in <code>SBCL</code>.

<p> Some linux environments for Windows:

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtual box</a>
<li> <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>
</ul>

<p> As long as it gives you <code>bash, wget, unzip, sed, apt-get/brew</code>, anything's fine.
