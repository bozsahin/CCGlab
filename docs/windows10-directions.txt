This guide is prepared by Efecan Yilmaz. It gives you first a linux as W10 app, then ccglab. 
No partitions, no virtualbox.
Thanks.

---------------

You need to be on version 1909 of Windows10, build 18363.476. Versions and/or builds newer than these are unlikely to cause problems.

1. Open a Powershell window *with administrator rights* and execute the following command:

	Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

	(This will ask at the end your computer to be restarted; say YES)

2. Go to Windows Store (search for "store" in Windows Search), and search for "Linux"
	- Download your preferred distribution (we recommend Ubuntu, which requires the least amount of effort in configuration.)
	- When the download and installation finishes, click on "Launch" in the Store window for the first time installation to take place.
	- Please note your username and password at the end of the installation. 


3. do: cd ~

4. do: pwd

This shows the full path of your username. It's best to use that path in installing all ccglab related software if asked.

5. do: git clone https://github.com/bozsahin/ccglab 

6. Proceed with ccglab installation guide (for Ubuntu) at  https://github.com/bozsahin/ccglab/README.md.

7. do: bash

8. do: ccglab

You are ready to go. You can close the linux app when you are done. To run again, locate ubuntu app from windows left corner button and run; once in ubuntu, just call cccglab. 

Next time you run the linux app, just do step 8.
