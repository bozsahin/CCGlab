This guide is prepared by Efecan Yilmaz. It gives you first a linux as W10 app, then ccglab. 
No partitions, no virtualbox.
Thanks.

---------------

You need to be on version 1909 of Windows10, build 18363.476. Versions and/or builds newer than these are unlikely to cause problems.

1. Open a Powershell window WITH ADMINISTRATOR RIGHTS and execute the following command:

	Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

	(This will ask at the end your computer to be restarted; press 'Enter' at the prompt)
	
	[Powershell can be located from left bottom corner window logo. Right click will show admin run option.]

2. Go to Windows Store (search for "store" in Windows Search), and search for "Linux"
	- Download your preferred distribution (we recommend Ubuntu, which requires the least amount of effort in configuration.)
	- When the download and installation finishes, click on "Launch" in the Store window for the first time installation to take place.
	- Please note your username and password at the end of the installation. 

3. do: pwd

This shows the full path of your username. It's best to use that path in installing all ccglab-related software when asked.

4. do: w10-install
