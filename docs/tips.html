<h3> <code>CCGlab</code> tips</h3>

<ol>
<li> Please do not change the contents of standard ccglab repository files in your <code>CCGLAB_HOME</code>
	directory, otherwise you will lose them in the next <code>git pull</code>.
	The script <code>ccglab</code> is accessible from anywhere.

<li> It is best to create a separate directory for every project. Many files might be created
	for a full project depending on your need (source grammar, translations to Lisp code, models, their translations, supervision files
	and their translation).


<li> Run <code>ccglab</code> script after changing to your project directory.
	That way you don't have to remember pathnames of your files.

<li> Parts of speech in <code>.ccg</code> grammars are entirely up to you.
	The manual explains why they are needed.

<li> If you are tired of writing LF constants in double quotes, like me,
look no further: exclaim them. Write <code>"life-prime"</code> as <code>!life-prime</code>.
It is internally converted to a string by a reader macro.

<li> If there is a syntax error in your <code>.ccg</code> file, you will find
out about it when you try to load the grammar. It will fail. Check the <code>.ccg.lisp</code>
	file; it shows you the place at which <b>the first error</b> occured, as reported by the LALR parser.
Fix that and run <code>(make-and-load-grammar)</code> to remake the <code>.ccg.lisp</code> file.
	
<li> The same is true of <code>.supervision</code> files. If there is an error in the file,
	check out the <code>.sup</code> file it is supposed to generate to find out the FIRST error.
	Re-run <code>make-supervision</code> after fixing the error in <code>.supervision</code> file.

<li> If you have installed and re-installed <code>CCGlab</code> many times,
check your <code>.bashrc</code> and <code>.bash_profile</code> files; there will be
various appends of same material at the end. The last one counts.
Get rid of the earlier ones, although they are harmless and non-effective. (In fact, keep a safe copy of <code>.bashrc</code>
and <code>.bash_profile</code> somewhere if you do multiple installs.)

<li> Make sure that your <code>PATH</code> shell variable is pointing to the correct
installation of <code>CCGlab</code> if you've done multiple installs. A new install
appends <code>$CCGLAB_HOME/bin</code> at the very beginning of <code>PATH</code>
to override earlier installs.
To see your PATH variable's value, do `<code>echo $PATH</code>'. 
<li> And, ehm, please read the manual as much as you can. Thanks.
</ol>
