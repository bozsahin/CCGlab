Lisp code for the masses, for something not so massive.

<p>
<big><code>CCGlab</code></big> is a tool to experiment with  Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG).

<p> We write <big><code>CCGlab</code></big> grammars as we do in CCG papers, and look at the output
in almost paper format (ok, almost).

<p> 
It implements all known combinators of CCG, and then some, in all variants and powers.
Lexical rules, slash modalities,
and meta-categories such as (X\X)/X have been implemented. The manual
describes the range of possible <big><code>CCGlab</code></big> grammars.

<p>It also implements probabilistic CCG, aka PCCG. In its tool-supplied form, only lexical features are used, which you can amend.
Parameter estimation and update are provided.
Therefore model training is possible.
Models and grammars use the same format.

<p> In deduction mode, <code>CCGlab</code> gives you all parses of a string, along with logical forms.
In induction mode, it gives you the most likely LF for a string, its most likely derivation, and the most likely derivation for any LF
for the string. Both are based on the same CKY parse engine and the same grammar format.

<p> The main features of <code>CCGlab</code> which distinguish it from other publicly available CCG code:
<ul>
<li> The logical form is associated with the entire category, via self-contained and lisp-free lambda-calculus.
<li> Unification plays no linguistic role; basic categories and their atomic features are matched for term consistency only.
<li> All combinators are available all the time, in their powers (linear, quadratic, cubic). 
<li> Type-raising is not built-in, because it does not combine. Facilities are provided for it, such as 
lexical rules and morpholexical generalizations.
<li> We can do deduction on a statistically-trained grammar, and induction on a linguistically-motivated grammar, because the grammar 
format is the same, and feature counts are always calculated by CKY independent of mode of use. The first one is helpful in fine-tuning a model. The second one is helpful in prioritizing the lexical assumptions.
</ul>

<p> 
<code>CCGlab</code> is designed with linguists, cognitive scientists, and computational linguists
in mind. 
You can use it for quick check of CCG ideas, or for large-scale development
of grammars and models.
