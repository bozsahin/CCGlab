#     we dont advise filenames with spaces and quotes; makes life difficult for bash
#     no comments on dataset; just data. Number of threads needed is calculated from line count.
#     It's good to have save option set to t in data otherwise you have to decipher garbled output.
#     There is no telling in what order threads will be run.
